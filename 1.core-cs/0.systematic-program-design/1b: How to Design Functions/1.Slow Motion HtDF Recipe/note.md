# How to Design Functions (HtDF): A Systematic Approach to Function Development

## Steps

1. - **Signature:** Signature will show what a function takes as input and what  is the output of the function.
    - **Purpose:** Clearly state the purpose of the function. What is its role or objective?
    - **Stub:** Create a stub with the same name and parameters. This will serve as a placeholder for the function. 

2. **Examples (wrapped in check-expect)**
    - Develop examples that demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. These examples serve as test cases and help clarify the function's functionality.

3. **Inventory - template & constants**
    - Identify and create a template for the function's structure. This includes the function's header, parameter names, and return type. Define any constants or fixed values that the function will use.

4. **Code body**
    - Write the actual code for the function. Use the template and constants from the inventory to guide the structure of the function. Follow the purpose and requirements outlined in the signature.

5. **Test and Debug**
    - Test the function with the examples provided earlier. Ensure that the function produces the expected output for each test case. Debug any errors or unexpected behavior that may arise during testing.

Remember, these steps are iterative, and you may need to revisit earlier steps as you refine your understanding of the problem or make adjustments to the function. The goal is to create well-designed, modular functions that are easy to understand, test, and maintain.
