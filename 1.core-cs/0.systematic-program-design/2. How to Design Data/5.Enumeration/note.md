# Enumaration

When we have a fixed set of values to represent, we use `Enumaration`.

## Examples

Traffic Light: `Red`, `Yellow`, `Green`
Letter Grade: `A`, `B`, `C`

## Note:

- Examples are redundant for `Enumaration` as it is a fixed set of values.
- One of the value is used to represent the `Enumaration` type itself. For example, `Red` is used to represent `Traffic Light` type.
- `Enumaration` is used to represent `distinct items`.
