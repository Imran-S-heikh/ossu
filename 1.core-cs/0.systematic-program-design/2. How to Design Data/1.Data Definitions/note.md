# HTDD Recipe

The first step of the recipe is to identify the inherent structure of the information.

Once that is done, a data definition consists of four or five elements:

1. A possible structure definition (not until compound data)
2. A type comment that defines a new type name and describes how to form data of that type.
3. An interpretation that describes the correspondence between information and data.
4. One or more examples of the data.
5. A template for a 1 argument function operating on data of this type.
