# Understanding Expressions in Racket

An expression in Racket is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result. It represents a computation or operation that yields a specific value.

## Example Expression

Consider the expression:

```racket
(+ 3 4)
```

This expression evaluates to 7, and it is an example of a simple arithmetic operation (addition). The + is a primitive function, and 3 and 4 are the expressions being added.

## General Structure of an Expression

Expressions in Racket follow a general structure: <br>
`(<primitive> <expression>...)`

Here, `<primitive>` represents a primitive function or operator, and `<expression>`... denotes one or more expressions that serve as its arguments.

## Expressions and Values

Expressions can represent various types of values. For instance, simple numeric values are expressions by themselves:

```racket
42 ; This is an expression representing the number 42
```

## Summary

- An expression is a combination of elements that, when evaluated, produces a value.
- Expressions can involve primitive functions, operators, and operands.
- The general structure of an expression is <primitive> `<expression>`....
- Values, such as numbers, can also be considered expressions.

Understanding expressions is fundamental in Racket programming, as they are the building blocks for creating computations and algorithms.
